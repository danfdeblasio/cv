 abstract = {
            We present the phylogeny analysis software \texttt{SICLE} (\textbf{Si}ster \textbf{Cl}ade \textbf{E}xtractor), an easy-to-use, high-throughput tool to describe the nearest neighbors to a node of interest in a phylogenetic tree as well as the support value for the relationship. The application is a command line utility that can be embedded into a phylogenetic analysis pipeline or can be used as a subroutine within another C++ program. As a test case, we applied this new tool to the published phylome of \textit{Salinibacter ruber}, a species of halophilic Bacteriodetes, identifying 13 unique sister relationships to \textit{S. ruber} across the 4,589 gene phylogenies. \textit{S. ruber} grouped with bacteria, most often other Bacteriodetes, in the majority of phylogenies, but 91 phylogenies showed a branch-supported sister association between \textit{S. ruber} and Archaea, an evolutionarily intriguing relationship indicative of horizontal gene transfer. This test case demonstrates how \texttt{SICLE} makes it possible to summarize the phylogenetic information produced by automated phylogenetic pipelines to rapidly identify and quantify the possible evolutionary relationships that merit further investigation. \texttt{SICLE} is available for free for noncommercial use at http://eebweb.arizona.edu/sicle/.

title="Boosting Alignment Accuracy by Adaptive Local Realignment",
bookTitle="Research in Computational Molecular Biology: 21st  Annual International Conference, RECOMB 2017, Hong Kong, China, May 3-7, 2017, Proceedings",

abstract="While mutation rates can vary markedly over the residues of a protein, multiple sequence alignment tools typically use the same values for their scoring-function parameters across a protein's entire length. We present a new approach, called adaptive local realignment, that in contrast automatically adapts to the diversity of mutation rates along protein sequences. This builds upon a recent technique known as parameter advising that finds global parameter settings for aligners, to adaptively find local settings. Our approach in essence identifies local regions with low estimated accuracy, constructs a set of candidate realignments using a carefully-chosen collection of parameter settings, and replaces the region if a realignment has higher estimated accuracy. This new method of local parameter advising, when combined with prior methods for global advising, boosts alignment accuracy as much as 26{\%} over the best default setting on hard-to-align protein benchmarks, and by 6.4{\%} over global advising alone. Adaptive local realignment, implemented within the Opal aligner using the Facet accuracy estimator, is available at                   facet.cs.arizona.edu                                  .",

abstract="In a computed protein multiple sequence alignment, the coreness of a column is the fraction of its substitutions that are in so-called core columns of the gold-standard reference alignment of its proteins. In benchmark suites of protein reference alignments, the core columns of the reference alignment are those that can be confidently labeled as correct, usually due to all residues in the column being sufficiently close in the spatial superposition of the known three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Typically the accuracy of a protein multiple sequence alignment that has been computed for a benchmark is only measured with respect to the core columns of the reference alignment. When computing an alignment in practice, however, a reference alignment is not known, so the coreness of its columns can only be predicted.",
